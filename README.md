===========================

Java SDK for the TextRazor Text Analytics API

TextRazor offers state-of-the-art natural language processing tools through a simple API, allowing you to build semantic technology into your applications in minutes.

Hundreds of applications rely on TextRazor to understand unstructured text across a range of verticals, with use cases including social media monitoring, enterprise search, recommendation systems and ad targetting.

Getting Started
===============

- Download the latest [TextRazor JAR](https://github.com/crayston/textrazor-java/blob/master/bin/textrazor-1.0.0.jar)
  TextRazor for Java depends on the Jackson JSON library, specifically jackson-core-2.1.4.jar, jackson-annotations-2.1.4.jar, jackson-databind-2.1.4.jar.  Ensure that these are on your classpath when running your project.

- Alternatively, if you use maven you can add a dependency to TextRazor in your pom.xml


Usage
=====

You'll need a [free API key](https://www.textrazor.com) to add to your requests.
For example usage see [an example](https://github.com/crayston/textrazor-java/blob/master/test/com/textrazor/TestTextRazor.java).

Full JavaDoc can be found as part of the package, or viewed online at the TextRazor site.
